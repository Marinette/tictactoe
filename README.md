# tictactoe
Simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python

THIS IS HOW THE GAME BOARD LOOKS LIKE:
ONE   | TWO   | THREE
FOUR  | FIVE  | SIX
SEVEN | EIGHT | NINE

Rules:
1. When the game starts, you have a mini game where the two players decide on a number from 1-10, the closest guess gets to go first.
2. When it's your turn, type the position you want to place yourself in based off of the diagram above: (Ex: "ONE")
